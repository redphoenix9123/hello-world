# hello-world
My first github repository. Hello Wolrd!

Hi this is redphoenix. I enjoy coding in C# and C++. Unfortunately the dominant language in scripting for FiveM (a GTA V modification) is lua so that's what I've been using primarily lately. This project is a basic hello world repository to get me started in github.
